## Background
- Recently while studying computer vision, I realized the need to perform image quality assessment on processed or enhanced images. To facilitate the computation of these metrics, I decided to develop a program.<br>
- After completing the batch computation of PSNR and SSIM in the program, I found [IQA](https://github.com/chaofengc/IQA-PyTorch). This means that I no longer need to worry about the computational aspects. Therefore, I plan to build a graphical executable program on top of it to enhance usability and ease of operation.

## Highlights
- Maybe a convenient tool

## Usage
Now just PSNR and SSIM
```
python evaFunc.py -o your/folder1 -p your/folder2
```
